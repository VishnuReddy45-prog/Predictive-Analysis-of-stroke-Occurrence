# Predictive-Analysis-of-stroke-Occurrence using SAS
This project utilizes SAS to predict stroke risk based on key demographic and health variables like age, hypertension, heart disease, BMI, and smoking status. Using Chi-square tests and binary logistic regression, it identifies significant predictors and moderation effects. Findings help improve healthcare interventions and insurance risk assessments. The study highlights the role of predictive modeling in stroke prevention and policymaking. 

Problem Statements

We checked if there is a moderation effect between age and metabolic health indicators (such as heart_disease, BMI, and average glucose level) that influence stroke risk across the different populations ? 

Method Used: Binary logistic Regression with moderation effect
