# Predictive-Analysis-of-stroke-Occurrence using SAS

This project utilizes SAS to predict stroke risk based on key demographic and health variables like age, hypertension, heart disease, BMI, and smoking status. Using Chi-square tests and binary logistic regression, it identifies significant predictors and moderation effects. Findings help improve healthcare interventions and insurance risk assessments. The study highlights the role of predictive modeling in stroke prevention and policymaking.

The Dataset consists of 10 metrics for a list of Patients. These metrics included Patients health records (hypertension, heart disease, average glucose level, body mass index (BMI), smoking status and history of stroke) as well as their demographic information (gender, age, marital status, kind of employment and residence type).

This dataset’s Primary goal is to predict stroke for individual patients who are at higher risk based on various variables. It can be accomplished by:

Identifying Risk Factors: By analyzing the relationships between variables like age, hypertension, heart disease, and stroke occurrence. Researchers can identify the key factors that increase stroke risk.

Purpose

Developing Predictive Models: Using their demographic and health information, we can fit models to this data to estimate a person’s risk of stroke.
Developing Predictive Models: Using their demographic and health information, we can fit models on this data to estimate a person’s risk of stroke.
Monitoring Stroke Risk: Monitoring an individual’s stroke risk can be improved by tracking changes in these variables over time.

The Dataset includes the following variables:

Problem Statements
We checked if there is a moderation effect between age and metabolic health indicators (such as heart_disease, BMI, and average glucose level) that influence stroke risk across the different populations ? 
Method Used: Binary logistic Regression with moderation effect
Predictor Variables: heart_disease, age
Outcome Variable: Stroke

Conceptual Diagram of the moderation effect:

Moderation Effect: A moderation effect, also known as an interaction effect, occurs when the relationship between two variables changes depending on the level or presence of a third variable. The effect of one variable on an outcome is influenced by the presence or level of another variable.
